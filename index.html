The app has various capabilites, it helps you create your event with as much or little help the user needs, and it recommends the user with various items/personel for the event. It is simply the best app to plan your event.</p>

												<h2><a>What matters to get the best<br />
												Mutual Fund Risk Adjusted Returns</a></h2>
											</header>
											<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/stock.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<p>I fooled you right, you thought I found the way to make you a billionaire, well sadly I do not know how to do that yet. The title is misleading. The paper talks about what matters in a fund manager to get the best returns. The paper was created by analyzing data of fund managers and using statistical methods to process the data to find what qualities matter in a fund manager to get the best returns. The data was processed with STATA, however this could be easily be done in Julia, Python or R.</p>

												<h2><a>Buses R Us</a></h2>
											</header>
											<a class="image fit"><img src="images/bus.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<p>Buses R Us is an android app that models the transit of all the buses in Vancouver with their location and scheduled time with the help of the translink api. The project was developed with Java. This is the first large project I made in UBC. It was for my software construction class. This project made me learn how to parse data, make use of api's and do complex programming tasks. While I would love to share the full app, I am not allowed. The structure of the app was made with ubc proprietary software. However, if you will like to know more you can see the README in the GitHub page or contact me personally.</p>
